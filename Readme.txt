Objective: Build an end-to-end RAG application capable of processing large PDFs with persistence.

Ingestion: Use a semantic chunking strategy to produce coherent, self-contained data segments.

Storage: Implement Pinecone Vector Database (VDB) for retrieval.

Intelligence: Deploy a high-quality LLM with advanced context reasoning to accurately process queries.

Deliverable: A fully functional, production-grade application.
